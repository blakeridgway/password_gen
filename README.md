# Random Password Generator

Welcome to my Random Password Generator!  
This is a simple Python app I created to quickly generate strong and secure passwords.

## Features
- Generate random passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Choose your desired password length (default is 16 characters).
- Easy-to-use interface with prompts to guide you.

## How to Use
1. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Enter the desired password length when prompted (or press Enter to use the default).
3. Copy and use your new password wherever you need.
4. Generate additional passwords or exit when you're done.

## Why I Built This
I built this app to make it easier to generate strong passwords on the fly, especially for online accounts or projects that need secure credentials.

## Notes
- Make sure to keep your passwords secure and never share them with others.
- If you find this useful, feel free to customize it or suggest improvements!
